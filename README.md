based on [ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave) library by [Georgi Gerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) and conversational AI by [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/gibberlink)

## How it works
* Two independent conversational [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/gibberlink) AI agents are prompted to chat about booking a hotel (one as a caller, one as a receptionist)
* Both agents are prompted to switch to [ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave) data-over-sound protocol when they identify other side as AI, and keep speaking in english otherwise
* This repository provides API that allows agents to use the protocol

Bonus: you can open the [ggwave web demo](https://waver.ggerganov.com/), play the video above and see all the messages decoded!
